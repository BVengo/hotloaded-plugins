# Hotloading Plugins Project
My 'Hotloading Plugins' project consists of the two repositories 'hotloaded-server' and 'hotloaded-plugins'. The project is a test for having a running server that will update a dependency and reload it dynamically without any necessary downtime.

See [Hotloaded Server](https://github.com/BVengo/hotloaded-server) for the primary repository, which includes a longer `README`.
